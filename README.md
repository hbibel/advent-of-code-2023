# Advent of Code 2023

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an
[Advent calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar) of
programming puzzles that you can solve for fun. This repository contains my
solutions to each day's puzzles.

I'm using Rust as a programming language to solve each puzzle as I want to get
more practice in this language. These puzzles focus heavily on some of the
staples of any programming project, namely iteration, parsing text data, and
implementing data structures and algorithms. As any code is written for
one-time use, I'm not putting any effort in maintainability.
